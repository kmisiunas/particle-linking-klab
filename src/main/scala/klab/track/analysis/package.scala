 * In many cases it makes sense to get back a matrix or a vector as a result.
 * It seems that Map works well to package these, where key is a string.
 *
 * Functions with matrix of vector output in a Map will always have name "matrixForm",
 * also some other result types should be allowed to be converted into matrix form
